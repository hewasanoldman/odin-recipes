        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 pinch white pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup cornstarch</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Sauce</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 pinch white pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup cornstarch</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Whisk egg in large mixing bowl. Add chicken, salt, sugar, and pepper; mix well. Gradually mix in cornstarch until the chicken is well coated.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, carefully drop one piece of chicken at a time into the hot oil. Fry until chicken turns golden brown and begins to float, about 3 minutes. Remove chicken to a plate and allow to cool as you fry the next batch.</li>
        <li>Once all chicken has been fried, refry the chicken, starting with the first batch. Fry until chicken turns deep golden brown, about 2 more minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        <li>Prepare sauce: Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Stir in green onion, garlic, whole chilies, and orange zest. Cook and stir until garlic turns golden and chilies brighten, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add sugar, soy sauce, chicken broth, peanut oil, rice vinegar, sesame oil, and ginger; bring to a boil and cook for 3 minutes. Dissolve 2 teaspoons cornstarch in water and stir into the sauce. Return to a boil and cook until the sauce thickens and is no longer cloudy, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir chicken into the boiling sauce. Reduce heat to low and cook until chicken is heated through and has absorbed some sauce, about 3 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
